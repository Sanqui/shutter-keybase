This is a Shutter plugin for "uploading" screenshots to the Keybase
filesystem (KBFS).  It simply copies the screenshot to your public
/keybase folder and provides the keybase.pub URL.

Instructions:
* Copy Keybase.pm to /usr/share/shutter/resources/system/upload_plugins/upload/
* Inside Shutter preferences, fill in your Keybase username and enter
  anything in the password field (it will not be used)
